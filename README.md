Description:

This project uses OpenLayers to show the players a map in order to help with locating/finding the answer for the question on the left side of the screen. The player has to answer 10 random questions in order to complete the game. Once they have finished, they will get a score out of 10, having a score of 5 or below is a fail whilst having a score of over that is a pass. The questions are all randomized each playthrough, thus enchances the replayability of the quiz. Aside from this, after the player answers a question, it will have an explaination on top of the correct answer location. This can help players not only understand why they might get the question wrong but also where the location is.
